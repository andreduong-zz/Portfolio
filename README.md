# About Me

I am an undergrad, Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Dallas. Initially, I was aiming to become a full-stack software engineer until one day when I discovered Machine Learning. As a math lover since I was in elementary school, I realized this might be a thing I want to do for a living. After participating in HackAI at my school in late 2018, I went through hundreds of online resources, MOOCs, online forum, and studied the prerequisite for the next few months. I started building my portfolio and doing side projects in Summer 2019. The journey has been surreal so far, and I hope I can find some opportunities to gain some industry experience during my upcoming Sophomore year in college.

I have varied interests. Software, tech, weighlifting, HipHop culture, skateboarding, basketball, you name it. I am also a data nerd - I follow extensively Billboard music chart and movie box office in my free time. Feel free to hit me up with any questions or opportunities that you think would interest me.

More information about my academic journey can be found in my [resume]. (links will be updated soon).

# My Projects

## [Box Office Prediction: A Project](https://github.com/andreduong/box-office-prediction)

In a world where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? Having been following box office as a side hobby for a while, this project was definitely one of my favorites to do. In this project, I practiced data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, building various boosting models (XGBoost, CatBoost), and simple ensemble learning.


## [My First Web Scraper](https://github.com/andreduong/my-first-web-scraper)

I am a big NBA fan. As the season has ended, here we are scraping the top NBA player stats this season. In this project, I tried web scraping for the first time ever using BeautifulSoup, and then performed some brief data analysis.
