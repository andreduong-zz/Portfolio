The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. You need to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy from the dataset.

In this project, I practiced data preprocessing, feature extraction with PCA, looked at various clustering metrics (inertias, silhouette scores), experimented with various Clustering algorithms (KMeans Clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Clustering), data visualizations, and business analytics. This is also my first try on the business side of Data Science.

**Keywords:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Extraction, PCA, Inertias, Silhouette Scores, K-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Clustering

In a world where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? 

Having been following box office as a side hobby for a while, this project was definitely one of my favorites to do. In this project, I practiced data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, feature engineering, building various boosting models (XGBoost, CatBoost), and simple ensemble learning.

**Keywords:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering, Dimensionality Reduction, XGBoost, CatBoost, Ensemble Learning
