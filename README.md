### [Cactus Identification: A Walkthrough from CNN to Transfer Learning with Pre-Trained Model VGG16](https://github.com/andreduong/aerial-cactus-identification)

![pic](pictures/test-10.png)

This project was my introduction to the world of Computer Vision using Deep Learning. In this write-up, I will do a walkthrough of the whole classifier making process, including:

* Data preprocessing

* Build a Convolutional Neural Network 

* Evaluate the model

* Make tweaks to improve performance: data augmentation, progressive resizing

* Apply transfer learning with a pre-trained model (VGG16)

* Test the model by making prediction on first 10 images from the test set

* Experiment with interactive testing using OpenCV

**Keywords:** Neural Network, CNN, Data Augmentation, Progressive Resizing, Transfer Learning, Pre-Trained Model, VGG16, OpenCV

The sample Dataset summarizes the usage behavior of about 9000 active credit card holders during the last 6 months. You need to develop a customer segmentation to define marketing strategy from the dataset.

In this project, I practiced data preprocessing, feature extraction with PCA, looked at various clustering metrics (inertias, silhouette scores), experimented with various Clustering algorithms (KMeans Clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Clustering), data visualizations, and business analytics. This is also my first try on the business side of Data Science.

**Keywords:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Extraction, PCA, Inertias, Silhouette Scores, K-Means Clustering, Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Clustering

In a world where movies made an estimated $41.7 billion in 2018, the film industry is more popular than ever. But what movies make the most money at the box office? How much does a director matter? Or the budget? Having been following box office as a side hobby for a while, this project was definitely one of my favorites to do.

In this project, I went through the entire data science lifecycle, including:

* Data wrangling/preprocessing

* Exploratory data analysis/Data visualization

* Feature engineering

* Pipelines Building

* Dimensionality reduction with TruncatedSVD

* Building various boosting models (XGBoost, LightGBM)

* Applying simple ensemble method (stacking)

### [Dog Or Cat - A Simple Computer Vision Flask API](https://github.com/andreduong/dog-vs-cat-flask-api)

![api](pictures/home.png)

When a data scientist develops a machine learning model, the ultimate goal is to make it available in production. However, a lot of the times we just want a simple way to call a REST API and get predictions using the current classifier. In this project, I created a Computer Vision Flask API to classify dog/cat and find the most dominant color in a picture.

**Keywords:** Flask, REST API, Computer Vision, Model Deployment

### [My First Web Scraper](https://github.com/andreduong/my-first-web-scraper)

![ball](pictures/basketball.png)

I am a big NBA fan. As the season has ended, here we are scraping the top NBA player stats this season. In this project, I tried web scraping for the first time ever using BeautifulSoup, and then performed some brief data analysis.

**Keywords:** Web Scraping, BeautifulSoup, EDA
