# Data Science Portfolio

## About Me

I am an undergrad, Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Dallas. Initially, I was aiming to become a full-stack software engineer until one day when I discovered Machine Learning. As a math lover since I was in elementary school, I realized this might be a thing I want to do for a living. After participating in HackAI at my school in late 2018, I went through hundreds of online resources, MOOCs, online forum, and studied the prerequisite in the next few months. I started building my portfolio and doing side projects in Summer 2019. The journey has been surreal so far, and I hope I can find some opportunities to gain some industry experience during my upcoming Sophomore year in college.

I have varied interests. Software, tech, weighlifting, HipHop culture, skateboarding, basketball, you name it. I am also a data nerd - I follow extensively Billboard music chart and movie box office in my free time. Feel free to hit me up with any questions or opportunities that you think would interest me.

More information about my academic journey can be found in my [resume]. (links will be updated soon).
